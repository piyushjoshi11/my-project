A component for the Announcement entity, supports serialization and de-serialization of Announcement objects and can be used from
both backend and frontend.

## Get started

Install and use the component in your code:

```ts
import { Announcement } from '@my-org/my-project.entities.announcement';

const announcement = Announcement.from({
  name: 'Introducing new Bit Cloud',
  date: new Date().toString()
});
```

## Mock data

You can use announcement mock data for development and testing purposes using the `mockAnnouncements` API.

```ts
import { mockAnnouncements } from '@my-org/my-project.entities.announcement';

const announcements = mockAnnouncements();
console.log(announcements);
```
